# ft_container
Reimplementation of STL containers such as vector, stack and map. 42 School project.

## Guideline

### Begining of Vector :

This is a roadmap. Elements have to be done from the top to the bottom of the list.

- Member types
- constructor / destructor
- assign() / operator=
- get_allocator
- element access

Then :
- iterator
- modifiers
- capacity
